\title{Kronecker Graphs for Modelling Linguistic Data}


\section{Reaction Papers}

Multifractals paper, Kronecker intro paper, Cosma power laws ppaer

\subsection{Summary}
%What was the main technical content of the papers?
%How do papers relate to the topics presented in the course?
%What is the connection?
\subsection{Critique}
%What are strengths and weaknesses of the papers and how they are addressed?
%What were the authors missing?
%Was anything particularly unrealistic?
\subsection{Brainstorming}
%What are promising further research questions in the direction of the papers?
%How could they be pursued?
%An idea of a better model for something? A better algorithm? A test of an algo or model on a dataset?

\section{Project Proposal}
%% test of a model or algorithm on a dataset or on simulated data
Do the kronecker fit on a bigram model to make language model
%% a proposal for a model or algorithm that potentially extends or improves the topics discussed in the papers
Use it as a language model for MT, I don't know
I know what I'm doing, but what are you?
Maybe sample from it for language modelling
