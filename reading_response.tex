\title{Kronecker Graphs for Modelling Linguistic Data}

\section{Reaction Papers}

MEJ Newman power laws paper, Kronecker intro paper, Multifractals paper

\subsection{Summary}
%What was the main technical content of the papers?
MEJ power laws paper says that you should graph with CDFs, talk about the informational meaning of words

Kronecker intro paper says do a fractal on the adjacency matrix, construed as a picture. There are these long list of properties, heavy tail for indegree, heavy tail for outdegree, densification power law, small diameters. Note that it's not searchable in this case.

Multifractal says do multifractal on the adjacency matrix to generalize and to think of it in the limit into infinity.

%How do papers relate to the topics presented in the course?
They invoke many small-world properties at the same time and are therefore great models for a variety of natural networks. But the current literature has focused upon social networks, but there are many possible objects of network analysis. I want to explore one which doesn't appear much in the literature, which is the relation words have to each other. Instead of creating semantic nets, I want to explore the ones which are implicit in bigram models.

\subsection{Critique}
%What are strengths and weaknesses of the papers and how they are addressed?
%What were the authors missing?
No grammar, so the vocabulary and the grammar may be separate.

Other people have noted the lack of local search in stochastic kronecker graphs.
%Was anything particularly unrealistic?
Should be some kind of multifractal, but then the multifractal paper doesn't propose a nice search for it. Was there any real data in the multifractals paper?
\subsection{Brainstorming}
%What are promising further research questions in the direction of the papers?
%How could they be pursued?
%An idea of a better model for something? A better algorithm? A test of an algo or model on a dataset?

\section{Project Proposal}
%% test of a model or algorithm on a dataset or on simulated data
Do the kronecker fit on a bigram model to make language model
%% a proposal for a model or algorithm that potentially extends or improves the topics discussed in the papers
Use it as a language model for MT, I don't know
I know what I'm doing, but what are you?
Maybe sample from it for language modelling

Put in all the data that I have
